# GWGProject1

This is the first of 7 projects for the Grow with Google Udacity Scholarship for Front-End Web Dev. We were given a PDF mock-up with a minimal design and asked to create it and customize it using HTML5 and CSS3. The design is also required to be fully responsive.

This is the PDF: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/…/design-mockup-portf….

Here is the live version: https://mkaydub.github.io/PortfolioProject1/

Note: The links don't go anywhere (except the social media links) and the form does not collect data.

Let me know what you think!
